<br><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="derek" style="border:5px solid"><br>

I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from [Florida State University](http://www.fsu.edu/). I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), Fort Collins, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, both in electrical engineering, with an emphasis on statistical signal processing. My dissertation was advised by [Anuj Srivastava](http://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~anuj/) and [Wei Wu](http://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~wwu/) and focused modeling of unaligned functional data. Currently, I am a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. Recently, I received the Director of National Intelligence Team Award for contributions to the Signal Location in Complex Environments (SLiCE) team.

My main interest lies in the area of functional data analysis with a focus on geometric methods and unaligned data. My other research interests include statistical image understanding, statistical learning methods, and point procesess.
